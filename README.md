# FAIRIS

FAIRIS is a project framework that allows you to implement navigational control logic directly on the open-source robotic simulation platform Webots. With this framework, you can create your own Webots controller without the need to set up a simulated environment or robot, as we provide all the materials required to get started.

## Requirements

To work with FAIRIS, ensure that your system meets the following requirements:

### 1. Python 3.10+

#### **Windows Users**:
- **Important**: It’s crucial to install Python 3.10+ from the Microsoft Store to avoid potential issues with PATH configurations and permissions.
- **Installation Instructions**:
  1. Open the **Microsoft Store** on your Windows PC.
  2. In the search bar, type **"Python 3.10"**.
  3. Select **Python 3.10** from the list of results.
  4. Click **Get** or **Install** to download and install Python 3.10 on your machine.
     - [Microsoft Store Python 3.10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/images/store-install-python.png)  

  5. Once installed, verify the installation by opening Command Prompt and typing:
  
   ```shell
   python3 --version
   ```

  - This should return `Python 3.10.x` if installed correctly.

#### **Linux Users**:
- **Ensure you have Python 3.10+ installed.** Most distributions can install it using the package manager:
  
   ```shell
   sudo apt-get install python3.10
   ```

### 2. Cyberbotics Webots R2023b

FAIRIS works in conjunction with Webots version R2023b. Ensure you install Webots correctly:

#### **Linux Users**:
- **Do not install Webots from the Snap packaging** due to known compatibility issues. Instead, use the `.deb` 
  package or tarball for installation.
- **Installation Instructions**:
  - Follow the detailed installation guide [here](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/installation-procedure#installation-on-linux).

#### **Windows and macOS Users**:
- Download and install Webots R2023b from the official [Cyberbotics website](https://cyberbotics.com/#download).

### 3. Git

Ensure that you have Git installed to clone the FAIRIS repository:

- **Windows**: Download and install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
- **Linux**: Install Git via your package manager:
  
   ```shell
   sudo apt-get install git
   ```

- **macOS**: Install Git via Homebrew:
  
   ```shell
   brew install git
   ```

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up FAIRIS on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository onto your device. There are numerous ways to achieve this, and you can decide which option is best for you. If you plan to use this repo for a course or an extended period, we recommend that you clone the repo and perform pulls when an update is pushed. A complete guide on how to clone GitHub repositories can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

**Clone command:**

```shell
git clone https://github.com/biorobaw/FAIRIS.git
```

### 2. Set Up the Python Environment

#### a. **Open a Terminal Session**

- **MacOS**: Press Command + Space Bar, type "Terminal" in Spotlight, and click to open the app.
- **Linux**: Press Ctrl + Alt + T to instantly launch a Terminal window.
- **Windows**: Press the Windows Key + R, type `cmd.exe`, and press Enter.

#### b. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

Change your directory to the root of the FAIRIS project:

```shell
cd path_to/FAIRIS
```

#### c. **Create a Python Virtual Environment**

Run the provided script to create a Python virtual environment using Python 3.10+ and install all necessary dependencies.

```shell
python3 create_venv.py
```

This script will:
- Search for Python 3.10+ on your system and use it to create a virtual environment.
- Install all required libraries in the virtual environment.
- Add paths to the `fairis_tools` and `fairis_lib` packages.

### 3. Activate Python Virtual environment

After creating the virtual environment, you need to activate it before installing the FAIRIS packages.

#### **Windows**:

```shell
FAIRIS\ $ venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### **macOS/Linux**:

```shell
FAIRIS$ source venv/bin/activate
```

You should now see your terminal prompt change to indicate that the virtual environment is active (e.g., `(venv)` at the start of your command line).


### 4. Install FAIRIS Packages

#### a. With the virtual environment activated, install the FAIRIS packages:

```shell
pip install -e .
```

This command will install the `fairis_tools` and `fairis_lib` packages, making all classes and functions available for use in your Webots controllers.

#### b. clean up after the installation of FAIRIS packages:

```shell
rm -r fairis.egg-info/ 
```

This command will remove the fairis_lite.egg-info directory that are automatically generated during the 
installation process.  

### 5. Configure Webots

You can configure Webots to use the correct Python environment in two ways: by running an automatic script or manually creating the necessary `runtime.ini` files in each controller directory.

#### a. **Automatic Configuration**

Simply run the provided script to automatically create and configure the `runtime.ini` files in all controller directories:

```shell
python3 add_runtime_ini.py
```

This script will:
- Locate all controller directories under `Simulation/controllers/`.
- Create a `runtime.ini` file in each directory.
- Set the Python command to the correct virtual environment's Python executable.
- Note that you will need to run this everytime you create a new robot controller. 

#### b. **Manual Configuration**

If you prefer, you can manually create and configure the `runtime.ini` files. Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to each controller directory under `Simulation/controllers/`.
2. Create a file named `runtime.ini` in each directory.
3. Add the following content to the `runtime.ini` file:

```ini
[python]
COMMAND = path_to_your_venv/bin/python3
```

### Example Directory Structure for Manual Configuration

Here’s an example structure showing where to place the `runtime.ini` files:

```
FAIRIS/
├── Simulation/
│   ├── controllers/
│   │   ├── Example/
│   │   │   ├── Example.py
│   │   │   ├── runtime.ini  # Manually created
│   │   ├── my_controller/
│   │   │   ├── my_controller.py
│   │   │   ├── runtime.ini  # Manually created
│   └── ...other Simulation files...
├── fairis_lib/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── rosbot_lib
│   │   ├──__init__.py
│   │   ├── rosbot.py
│   │   ├── my_robot.py
│   ├── simulation_lib
│   │   ├──__init__.py
│   │   ├── ...other foundational modules...
│   └── ...other foundational modules...
├── setup.py
└── README.md
```

## PyCharm Integration (Optional)

FAIRIS supports PyCharm integration with Webots. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. Open the FAIRIS directory as a project in PyCharm.
2. Set the Python interpreter to the virtual environment created earlier.
3. Ensure the project structure includes the `fairis_tools` and `fairis_lib` directories.

For detailed instructions on configuring PyCharm with Webots, refer to this [guide](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-your-ide#pycharm).

---

## Testing the Setup

To ensure FAIRIS is set up correctly:

1. Launch Webots and open the world file located at `FAIRIS/Simulation/worlds/StartingWorld.wbt`.
2. Verify that the Template controller is running, which should add walls and place the robot in a starting location.
3. The robot should print sensor readings and move approximately 1.5 meters before stopping.
4. Use the reset button in the Webots interface to see this process repeat.

If everything works as expected, you’re ready to start developing your robot controllers in Webots using Python.
